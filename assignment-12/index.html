            "There's a moment of orderly silence before a football play begins. Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything is possible.Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide. From the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five."

                      <p>Michael was exceeding everyone's expectations on the football field. However, he was not exceeding expectations academically and needed help in school. He didn't have a ton of time before graduation to get his grades up. If he didn't graduate then no college football for him.</p>

                        <p> "I read a story the other day about a boy from The Projects. No daddy, in and out of foster care. He had been killed in a gang fight in Hurt Village.In the last paragraph, they talked about his superb athletic skills and how different his life might've been if he didn't fall behind. That could've been anyone. That could've been my son Michael but it wasn't and I suppose I have God to thank for that."</p>
