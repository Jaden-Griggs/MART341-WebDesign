      <p>"If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish that I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that look-away thing."</p>

        <p>Next week I start fifth grade. Since I've never been to a real school before, I am pretty much totally and completely petrified.</p>

          <p>Mom homeschools me. She used to be a children's-book illustrator. She draws really great fairies and mermaids.</p>

            <p>I can't say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn't be exactly true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like every other kid going to school.</p>

            <div>
              <p>I have a few really good friends now. Christopher is my best friend, followed by Zachary and Alex. We've known each other since we were babies. And since they've always known me the way I am, they're used to me.</p>
