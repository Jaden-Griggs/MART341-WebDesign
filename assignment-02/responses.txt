The world wide web are the pages people see when scrolling and the internet is the network you are connected to while looking on the web.
The internet connects multiple routers/computers all over the world.
The directory acts as the main source that contains files under it.
VCS is beneficial because I can work/look in files while other people are working on their own files.
My computer does not let me take screenshots.
Music is my favorite type of art.
