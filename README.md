The difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans are the things that help style your webpage. Div tags is an html element. Ids are used to label sections within the websites. Span tags is used to group html elements together.

The universal selector is indicated by (*). As for a class selector, it starts with (.) and select everything in the document that applies to it. An ID selector begins with (#) and is basically used the same way as a class selector. The colors I used were light pink, hot pink and silver. This assignment was very time consuming to me.
